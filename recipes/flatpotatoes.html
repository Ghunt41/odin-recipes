    <h3>This is a super simple recipe straight from my Dad. Its literally the best way to start any day, and still one of my favorite meals this world has to offer! This photo isn't his exactly, but its the closest looking thing I could find online.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As many Potatoes as you want(1-2 is good for 1 plate usually)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find an empty sink and wash all the dirt off your Potatoes. Usually a good sponge gets the job done quick.</li>
        <li>Use a potato peeler to peel all of your potatoes into very thin slices.</li>
        <li>Get out your trusty skillet and your desired frying oil. We usually use vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully place you're potato slices across the entire skillet, stack layer or 2 of sliced potatoes, this will allow for a soft inner layer.</li>
        <li>Fry on medium-high until your flat potatoes are golden brown. Then use a spatula to flip and do the same again.</li>
        <li>Once golden brown on both sides, you can remove them from the pan and season them however you'd like. If you followed this, they should be crunchy on the outside but gooey on the inside, which is how I love them. But you can adjust the process until they are perfect for you!</li>

    </ol>
